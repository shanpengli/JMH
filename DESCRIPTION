Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for the semi-parametric joint modeling of competing risks and longitudinal data in the presence of heterogeneous within-subject variability, proposed by Li and colleagues (2023) <arXiv:2301.06584>.
             The proposed method models the within-subject variability of the biomarker and associates it with the risk of the competing risks event. The time-to-event data is modeled using a (cause-specific) Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-fixed covariates. 
             The longitudinal outcome is modeled using a mixed-effects location and scale model. The association is captured by shared random effects. The model 
             is estimated using an Expectation Maximization algorithm.
