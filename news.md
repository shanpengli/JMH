# JMH 1.0.3
* Use adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature rule to perform numerical integration to enable fast fitting of joint model. Develop ```AUCJMMLSM``` to assess the dynamic prediction accuracy by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  

# JMH 1.0.2

* A first R package for joint model of longitudinal and competing risks time-to-event data in the presence of heterogeneous within-subject variability.
