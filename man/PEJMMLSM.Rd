\usage{
PEJMMLSM(
  object,
  seed = 100,
  landmark.time = NULL,
  horizon.time = NULL,
  obs.time = NULL,
  method = c("Laplace", "GH"),
  quadpoint = NULL,
  maxiter = 1000,
  n.cv = 3,
  survinitial = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class 'PEJMMLSM'.}

\item{seed}{a numeric value of seed to be specified for cross validation.}

\item{landmark.time}{a numeric value of time for which dynamic prediction starts..}

\item{horizon.time}{a numeric vector of future times for which predicted probabilities are to be computed.}

\item{obs.time}{a character string of specifying a longitudinal time variable.}

\item{method}{estimation method for predicted probabilities. If \code{Laplace}, then the empirical empirical
estimates of random effects is used. If \code{GH}, then the pseudo-adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature is used.}

\item{quadpoint}{the number of pseudo-adaptive Gauss-Hermite quadrature points if \code{method = "GH"}.}

\item{maxiter}{the maximum number of iterations of the EM algorithm that the 
function will perform. Default is 10000.}

\item{n.cv}{number of folds for cross validation. Default is 3.}

\item{survinitial}{Fit a Cox model to obtain initial values of the parameter estimates. Default is TRUE.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
a list of matrices with conditional probabilities for subjects.
