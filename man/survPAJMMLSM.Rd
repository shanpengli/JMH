}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class \code{JMMLSM}.}

\item{ynewdata}{a data frame that contains the longitudinal and covariate information for the subjects 
for which prediction of survival probabilities is required.}

\item{cnewdata}{a data frame that contains the survival and covariate information for the subjects 
for which prediction of survival probabilities is required.}

\item{u}{a numeric vector of times for which prediction survival probabilities are to be computed.}

\item{s}{a numeric saclar. This specifies the known time at which each of 
the subjects in cnewdata was known to be alive.}

\item{obs.time}{a character string of specifying a longitudinal time variable in ynewdata.}

\item{LOCF}{a logical value to indicate whether the last-observation-carried-forward approach applies to prediction. 
If \code{TRUE}, then \code{LOCFcovariate} and \code{clongdata} must be specified to indicate 
which time-dependent survival covariates are included for dynamic prediction. Default is FALSE.}

\item{LOCFcovariate}{a vector of string with time-dependent survival covariates if \code{LOCF = TRUE}. Default is NULL.}

\item{clongdata}{a long format data frame where time-dependent survival covariates are incorporated. Default is NULL.}

\item{quadpoint}{number of quadrature points used for estimating conditional probabilities.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
a list of matrices with conditional probabilities for subjects.
}
